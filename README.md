# Odin Restaurant Page

## Description

This is my implementation of the Restaurant Page project from the JavaScript course in the Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript curriculum.

I created an HTML framework for a universal header/footer, and a navigation sidebar that enables tabbed browsing. In my main index.js file, I grabbed the three sidebar buttons and added click event listeners to them that would call the three page load functions imported from my three page load modules.

I also imported JSON data into my menuload.js file so that I wouldn't have to hard code in all of the menu items.

All images were generated by Microsoft Designer (https://designer.microsoft.com) and copy for the "menu" and "about" pages were generated with help from Microsoft Copilot (https://copilot.microsoft.com).
